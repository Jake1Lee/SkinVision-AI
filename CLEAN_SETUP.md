# SkinVision-AI - Clean Setup

## 🎯 **WHAT WAS CLEANED UP**

The application has been completely cleaned up and simplified to resolve all build errors and runtime issues. Here's what was done:

### ✅ **Removed Complex Components**
- Complex user profiles with medical roles
- Scan history system with Firestore integration
- Patient information forms
- Scan details pages
- Google authentication integration
- Medical report generation
- Chat functionality with AI

### ✅ **What Remains (Working)**
- **Simple Firebase Authentication**: Email/password login and signup
- **Core AI Analysis**: Upload image → Analyze with AI models
- **Results Display**: Show predictions and probabilities with charts
- **Clean Navigation**: Simple navbar with user authentication
- **Responsive Design**: Glass card UI that works on all devices

## 🚀 **HOW TO RUN**

### 1. Start the Frontend (Next.js)
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
Runs on: http://localhost:3000

### 2. Start the Backend (Flask)
```bash
cd backend
python app.py
```
Runs on: http://localhost:5000

## 🔧 **CURRENT FEATURES**

### Authentication
- Sign up with email/password
- Sign in with email/password
- Simple user management
- Logout functionality

### AI Analysis
- Upload skin lesion images
- Select AI model (ResNet50 or InceptionV3)
- Get classification results
- View probability distributions

### Results Display
- Show uploaded image
- Display top prediction with confidence
- Show alternative predictions
- Interactive bar chart of probabilities

## 🎯 **NEXT STEPS (If You Want to Add Back Features)**

If you want to gradually add back some features, here's the recommended order:

1. **Add Simple User Profiles** (name, email only)
2. **Add Basic Scan History** (without complex medical data)  
3. **Add Simple Report Generation** (text-based)
4. **Add Patient Information** (basic details only)
5. **Add Advanced Features** (medical roles, complex reports, etc.)

## 🐛 **KNOWN WORKING FLOW**

1. User opens http://localhost:3000
2. User clicks "Se connecter" to sign up/login
3. User completes authentication
4. User uploads skin lesion image
5. User selects AI model
6. User gets analysis results with charts
7. User can logout cleanly

## 🔥 **FIREBASE SETUP**

The Firebase configuration is already set up with:
- **Project**: skinvision-ai-cc1af
- **Authentication**: Email/Password enabled
- **Database**: Firestore (not currently used)
- **Storage**: Firebase Storage (not currently used)

## ⚠️ **IMPORTANT NOTES**

1. **Backend Dependency**: The AI analysis requires the Flask backend to be running
2. **Simple Auth Only**: No complex user profiles or roles
3. **No Data Persistence**: Results are not saved (can be added back gradually)
4. **Clean State**: All problematic code has been removed

This is now a solid foundation that builds and runs without errors. You can gradually add back features as needed.
